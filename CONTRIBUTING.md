# Contributing to GGStream

üëã Hi there! Thanks so much for wanting to contribute! This started as a hackathon project, so there's a lot of things that need polish or cleanup.
If you want to help out, here's a few ways to do so right now.

## File a bug report

Found a üêõ? I'm not surprised. This was a hackathon project, after all. 

When filing a bug report, please try to include the full URL where the bug happened, an approximate timestamp, and a screenshot if you can.

## Propose a feature

Thought of a new feature for GGStream? File an issue with the #feature label to let me know. 

Want to do it yourself? Even better! Just tag it with #help to let me know you're working on it.

## Contribute code

Wow, I'm flattered! Please get in touch by filing an issue first with the #help label to chat about it and make sure we're not duplicating work.
