# Contributing to GGStream

👋 Hi there! Thanks so much for wanting to contribute! This started as a hackathon project, so there's a lot of things that need polish or cleanup.
If you want to help out, here's a few ways to do so right now.

## File a bug report

Found a 🐛? I'm not surprised. This was a hackathon project, after all. 

File a [bug report](https://github.com/vladzaharia/ggstream/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) and fill out as much as you can.

## Propose a feature

Have a great 💡 for GGStream? File a [feature request](https://github.com/vladzaharia/ggstream/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.md&title=) to let me know. 

Want to do it yourself? Even better! Just tag it with the #help label to let me know you're working on it.

## Contribute code

Wow, I'm flattered! Please get in touch by filing an issue first with the #help label to chat about it and make sure we're not duplicating work. 

If you want to fix an existing issue, just add the #help label to it and mention me to let me know you're fixing it.
